install-skill subcommand.

Writes legacy2mcp usage instructions into the well-known AI-assistant context
files for a project (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex/AGENTS.md, Gemini, GitHub
Copilot), so an assistant working in that repo knows how to drive legacy2mcp
without being told from scratch each session. The files are plain text the
user can review and commit; nothing here is executed.

This mirrors the same install-skill pattern several other CLI tools use
(e.g. DockSec) for the same reason: a SKILL.md submitted to a marketplace is
great for discovery, but a repo's own CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/etc. is what an
assistant actually reads by default when it's already working in that repo.

legacy2mcp turns an existing SOAP/WSDL service, a database, a REST API, or a
plain website with no API docs into a safe, typed, audit-logged MCP server
-- read-only by default, every call audit-logged, no hand-written adapter
code or hand-maintained schemas.

Common commands:

- Point at a live WSDL (no API key needed; zeep introspects it live):
    legacy2mcp init --wsdl-url "https://service.example.com/Legacy?wsdl" --out config.yaml
- Point at a live REST API (tries OpenAPI/Swagger discovery, no API key needed):
    legacy2mcp init --rest-url "https://api.example.com" --out config.yaml
- Point at a website with no API docs at all (crawls it for forms/content;
  every operation lands confidence=low/needs_review=true -- review before trusting):
    legacy2mcp init --webpage-url "https://your-legacy-app.example.com/some-page" --out config.yaml
- Scan a GitHub repo or local codebase for a SOAP client / ORM model / routes:
    legacy2mcp init --github-url https://github.com/you/your-api --scan-only --out config.yaml
    legacy2mcp init --local-path ./path/to/repo --scan-only --out config.yaml
- See the real discovered tools before trusting anything (no server started):
    legacy2mcp inspect --config config.yaml
- Start the MCP server (an MCP client normally launches this itself --
  running it by hand just blocks waiting for a client over stdio):
    legacy2mcp run --config config.yaml

After `init`, review config.yaml's `# TODO` comments and the plain-English
config.html report before trusting the generated config -- it's a static/
introspected best effort, not yet verified against the live backend.
Write-like operations stay hidden unless `allow_write_operations: true` is
set explicitly, and every tool call is audit-logged to
./legacy2mcp-audit.log. Database access is an explicit table/column
allowlist generated from the live schema -- never arbitrary SQL.

To wire the generated server into an MCP client, add to its config (use an
absolute path to config.yaml):
    {"mcpServers": {"<name>": {"command": "legacy2mcp", "args": ["run", "--config", "/absolute/path/to/config.yaml"]}}}
