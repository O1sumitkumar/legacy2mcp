"""
Ready-to-paste MCP client connection config, generated from a just-written
config.yaml's real absolute path -- so "generate a server" and "wire it
into your AI client" are one flow instead of two (copying the shape by
hand out of README.md's "Client support" section, which this mirrors
exactly).

Every client here talks to legacy2mcp the same way: spawn `legacy2mcp run
--config <path>` over stdio. The JSON differs only in which key wraps the
server list (`mcpServers` vs `servers`) and whether a `type` field is
needed -- see README.md#client-support for the maintained source of truth
this is kept in sync with.
