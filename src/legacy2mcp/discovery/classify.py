"""
Turn a `scan.ScanResult` into a `Legacy2McpConfig`-shaped dict (plus a list
of human-readable TODOs for anything the scan couldn't pin down).

Precedence mirrors what legacy2mcp already supports, cheapest/most-certain
first: SOAP usage beats DB usage beats a plain route table, because a repo
that talks to a WSDL is almost certainly a thin wrapper around that SOAP
service, same for an ORM-backed app -- those map onto the existing `soap`/
`db` adapters with real schema introspection at startup. Only a repo with
no SOAP/DB signal falls back to the new `rest` adapter, which has to trust
the config as scanned since there's no live schema to check it against.

Nothing here ever enables a write operation -- `allow_write_operations`
is always emitted `false`, matching the rest of legacy2mcp's safety
posture; the generated config only ever flags which operations *could*
be turned on.
